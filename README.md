Machine Learning Algorithims in R
=================================

This repo contains the R script to accompany the coursera machine learning assingment.  It utilizes a dataset from sea-flow sensors, and conducts several machine learning algorithims on this data.  The results are compare to see which algorithim performs best and provides the most accurate predictions.  The required data can be found at <http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/> and instructions for the assignment are contained in the html file in this repo.
